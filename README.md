## 📊 **Dataset**
I used the **Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).  
### 📑 **Key Details**:
- **Rows**: 284,807 transactions  
- **Fraudulent Transactions**: ~0.17%  
- **Features**:  
  - 28 anonymized variables (`V1`, `V2`, ..., `V28`)  
  - `Time` and `Amount`  
  - Target variable: `Class` (0 = Non-Fraud, 1 = Fraud)

## 🧠 **Models Implemented**
### **1. Isolation Forest 🌲**
- An anomaly detection algorithm that isolates outliers.
- **Strengths**: Effective for high-dimensional data.
### 2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) 📍 
- Detects local deviations in data points compared to their neighbors.
- **Strengths**: Robust with imbalanced datasets.
### 3. Deep Learning (ANN) 🧬
- A neural network with fully connected layers for classification.
- **Strengths**: High accuracy for complex datasets.
