## 🧠 **Models Implemented**
### **1. Isolation Forest 🌲**
- An anomaly detection algorithm that isolates outliers.
- **Strengths**: Effective for high-dimensional data.
### 2. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) 📍 
- Detects local deviations in data points compared to their neighbors.
- **Strengths**: Robust with imbalanced datasets.
### 3. Deep Learning (ANN) 🧬
- A neural network with fully connected layers for classification.
- **Strengths**: High accuracy for complex datasets.
